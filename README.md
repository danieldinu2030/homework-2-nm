# Numerical Methods
# MATLAB Assignment - Function Numerical Methods

## Overview

The second Numerical Methods assignment features three different tasks with a well-documented solving process and a collection of MATLAB functions to perform specific pieces of this process. All tasks focus on real life applications of numerical methods for functions.

The three areas of interest for this project are: interpreting **sound waves** to create music, using **interpolation** in robotics and 
performing recommendations based on the **cosine similarity** method.

## Tasks

The three tasks have their own directory, containing:

- A `README.md` file which explains the numerical method and the set of necessary MATLAB functions
- The aforementioned set of MATLAB functions (mostly compatible with GNU Octave as well)
- A file containing the necessary input for testing
- A wrapper MATLAB function that correctly calls the others to completely solve the task
